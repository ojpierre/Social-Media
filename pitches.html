            <p class="content-description">
                Located just a short drive, less than half an hour from Carlisle, this riverside camping and glamping site offers the
                perfect escape into nature's embrace. While its proximity to Carlisle is convenient, the true allure lies in the
                surrounding natural beauty.
                
                For those seeking adventure, take a refreshing dip in the crystal-clear waters of the River Eden, or if you prefer to
                keep your feet dry, explore the stunning hiking trails that the Lake District has to offer.
                
                Our serene farm meadow hosts only ten camping pitches, each situated just a stone's throw away from the river. There's
                ample space for the kids to frolic and play. Every camping pitch includes a personal fire pit, perfect for cozy evening
                campfires. Plus, you'll find eco-friendly facilities nearby for added convenience.
                
                If you're in the mood for something unique, we offer a variety of quirky glamping options. Choose from cosy, exquisitely
                furnished glamping cabins to authentic gypsy caravans.
                
                Each glamping accommodation comfortably accommodates three to four guests and features a fully equipped kitchen, either
                indoors or outdoors. To elevate your experience, each unit boasts a private wood-fired hot tub for you to unwind in.
                Additionally, glampers have exclusive access to their own private composting toilet and hot shower facilities.
                
                For a fresh take on traditional pods, check out The Wigloo and The Lantern House. These unique wooden cabins feature
                skylights, creating a light and airy atmosphere with excellent insulation.
                
                Drawing inspiration from the rich Cumbrian farming heritage, you can opt for one of our two shepherd's wagons, The
                Herdwick and The Swaledale.
                
                The Croglin Yurt is a cosy haven filled with vintage and upcycled touches, promising a glamorous glamping experience.
                
                For a romantic retreat for two, choose Evelyn, the gypsy caravan, perched right on the riverbanks in a secluded spot.
                While soaking in the wood-fired outdoor Japanese bath hot tub, you might even catch a glimpse of the elusive otter!
                
                We're a pet-friendly site, welcoming well-behaved dogs to join your outdoor adventures.

                stroll from the car parking area, and we provide wheelbarrows to make transportation hassle-free.
                
                We also provide glamping accommodations, including spacious and cozy yurts, a meticulously crafted shepherd's hut, two

                handcrafted by skilled yurt-makers.
                
                The shepherd's hut and wagons are available for most of the year and offer comfort and insulation. The wagons feature

            <h2 class="content-subheading">High Bickington, Umberleigh, Devon</h2>
            <p class="content-description">
                Nestled near Umberleigh, this peaceful farm spans an impressive 30 acres of lush meadows and enchanting woodland. Here,
                a harmonious blend of traditional farming practices and sustainability principles creates an environmentally friendly
                haven.
                
                Wolf Meadows Farm is enveloped by hedgerows adorned with vibrant flowers and bountiful berry bushes, alongside ancient
                woodlands that beckon you to reconnect with nature. The farm is home to rare and endangered Highland cattle, a proud
                cockerel, and free-ranging hens that lay the finest eggs for your morning breakfast.
                
                All camping pitches are thoughtfully designed without electric hook-ups. You have the option to spread out across the
                sprawling meadow, bordered by the serene River Taw.
                
                For those seeking a more intimate riverside experience, we offer a limited number of riverside meadow pitches. Here, you
                can bask in the soothing sounds of the clear water, surrounded by ducks, geese, salmon, and perhaps even swans.
                
                A secluded section of wild bluebell woodland presents another unique camping opportunity. Shy deer occasionally grace us
                with their presence, and the area teems with diverse wildlife and vibrant wildflowers.
                
                For an even more immersive experience, we have three pitches within a wooded section that stretches down to the
                riverbank. From here, you can dip your toes in the water, observe the daily routines of otters, or drift off to sleep to
                the gentle melodies of birdsong.
                
                Our farm also boasts two eco-friendly glamping barrel pods inspired by Viking design. These cozy pods comfortably sleep
                four guests, with two double bedrooms each. They occupy secluded spots on the site, offering shared facilities within
                easy reach and an outdoor BBQ area for delightful campfires.
                
                Please note that the site is accessed via a narrow and winding road, but our friendly staff are always available to
                assist you with your arrival.
                
                <b>Wolf Meadows Farm welcomes guests from May 1st to October 31st. Join us for an unforgettable escape into the heart of
